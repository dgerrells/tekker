# What is Tekker?

Tekker is a site where I post about my experiences in technology.
I am an aspiring startup'er with the goal of using technology to make peoples lives easier.
I am right now in the process of building an MVP for my first startup and will be busy with that but will try and post from time to time.

Please feel free to leave a post.
